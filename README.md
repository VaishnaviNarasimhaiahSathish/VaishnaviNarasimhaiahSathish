Hi, I'm Vaishnavi 👋

Machine Learning & Data Science | Computer Vision | AI | NLP Enthusiast

I am a Master's student in Computer Science with hands-on experience building machine learning and deep learning models for real-world applications. My work spans medical imaging, computer vision, multimodal fusion, anomaly detection, LLM-based benchmarking, and data science workflows.

I enjoy building clean, reproducible pipelines and working on problems where AI can make a meaningful impact.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

> MRI segmentation (3D UNet) and clinical imaging workflows

> Medical X-ray classification for pneumonia detection

Multimodal image fusion (RGB + depth) for improved detection

> SemEval 2025 benchmarking (TF-IDF + SVM, Logistic Regression, BERT)

> Improving dataset preprocessing tools & evaluation pipelines

> Learning AWS/Azure for scalable ML workflows

## What I Care About

> Clean, reproducible ML workflows

> Data quality, dataset preparation & annotation

> Research-backed model improvements

> Communication and clear documentation
